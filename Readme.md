## 🫀 **Heart Disease Prediction/Detection System**

### 🔍 Overview

This project is a heart disease detection system built using **Python** with a graphical user interface powered by **Tkinter**. The system leverages an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical input parameters. The model is trained using authentic healthcare data sourced from hospitals in India.
